Coding Steps:
Create a full CRUD application of your choice. If you can use an existing API, use AJAX to interact with it. However, you do not have to use an API. If you do not use an API, store the entities you will create, read, update, and delete in an array.
Application should have at least 1 entity per team member
Use a form to add new entities
Build a way for users to update or delete entities
Use Bootstrap and CSS to style your project
